# Agent Instructions

## Project management with Taskulus

Use Taskulus for task management.
Why: Taskulus task management is MANDATORY here; every task must live in Taskulus.
When: Create/update the Taskulus task before coding; close it only after the change lands.
How: See CONTRIBUTING_AGENT.md for the Taskulus workflow, hierarchy, status rules, priorities, and command examples.
