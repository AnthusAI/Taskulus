Feature: In-memory index building

  @wip
  Scenario: Index builds lookup maps from issue files
    Given a Taskulus project with 5 issues of varying types and statuses
    When the index is built
    Then the index should contain 5 issues
    And querying by status "open" should return the correct issues
    And querying by type "task" should return the correct issues
    And querying by parent should return the correct children

  @wip
  Scenario: Index computes reverse dependency links
    Given a Taskulus project with default configuration
    And issue "tsk-aaa" exists with a blocked-by dependency on "tsk-bbb"
    When the index is built
    Then the reverse dependency index should show "tsk-bbb" blocks "tsk-aaa"
