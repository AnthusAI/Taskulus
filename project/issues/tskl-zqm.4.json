  "description": "Create tools/check_spec_parity.py to verify both implementations cover the same Gherkin steps.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Parse all .feature files in specs/features/\n2. Extract all Given/When/Then steps (excluding @wip scenarios)\n3. Parse Python step definitions in python/tests/step_definitions/\n4. Parse Rust step definitions in rust/tests/step_definitions/\n5. Report any steps defined in only one implementation\n6. Exit with error code if parity is broken\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** Tool runs successfully on empty step definition files, reports parity status, can be integrated into CI.\n\n**Integration:** Add to Makefile as make check-parity and to CI pipeline.",
