# Console App Agent Guidelines

## Brand Theme & Visual Design Policies

### Flat Design Only
- No gradients.
- No drop-shadows (unless totally flat/hard).
- No borders/outlines on containers or regions.

### Contrast & Separation
- Avoid thin lines for separating regions.
- Use varying background colors on flat rectangles with rounded corners to indicate regions and groupings.
- Use contrast carefully; avoid high contrast.
  - Background black should not be fully black (use dark gray).
  - Foreground white should not be fully white.
  - Use a limited set of official colors: not-black, not-white, and 2-3 muted colors.

### Color System
- Themes use Radix Colors (Cool, Neutral, Warm).
- Support both Light and Dark modes.

### Typography & Layout
- Refined elegance, modern Bauhaus-inspired, Apple's modern minimalist Art Deco.

### Spacing Rules
- Base all spacing on Tailwind integer steps (no `*-0.5` utilities).
- Preferred base unit: `p-2` and `gap-2`; stay within whole-step Tailwind scales.
- Avoid additional fractional spacing tiers.
