# Taskulus Public Website Scaffold

Base Gatsby 5 + Tailwind CSS project that mirrors the structure of
`../VideoML/videoml-org` and is ready to deploy on AWS Amplify Gen 2.

## Quick start

```bash
cd apps/taskul.us
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to preview the placeholder site. The home page
lists the follow-up tasks captured in Beads epic `tskl-0lb`.

## Deployment

1. Connect AWS Amplify Gen 2 to this repository and select the `apps/taskul.us`
   subdirectory.
2. Use the default build settings for Gatsby:

   ```yaml
   build:
     commands:
       - npm install
       - npm run build
   artifacts:
     baseDirectory: public
     files:
       - "**/*"
   ```

3. After the Amplify preview succeeds, continue with the DNS + domain tasks:
   - Create a Route 53 hosted zone for `taskul.us`.
   - Update GoDaddy name servers to point at Route 53.
   - Connect the custom domain to the Amplify app and request SSL.

## Reference project

Agents should inspect the prior implementation at
`/Users/ryan.porter/Projects/VideoML/videoml-org` for guidance on component
structure, layout primitives, and documentation patterns.

## Next steps

- Design and implement the final marketing/landing experience.
- Author content for each section.
- Wire analytics, contact forms, and additional routes as needed.
