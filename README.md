# Taskulus

**A git-backed project management system with dual Python and Rust implementations**

Taskulus is a lightweight, file-based issue tracker that stores all data as JSON files in your git repository. It replaces external tools like Jira and Confluence with a simple, version-controlled system that lives alongside your code.

## Status: Planning Phase

This repository contains the complete vision, implementation plan, and task breakdown for building Taskulus. We have **118 beads (tasks)** organized into **18 epics** with clear dependencies and acceptance criteria.

## Quick Overview

- **Issue Storage**: Each issue is a separate JSON file in `project/issues/`
- **Wiki System**: Jinja2-powered markdown templates with live issue queries
- **Dual Implementation**: Python for easy installation, Rust for maximum performance
- **Shared Specs**: Both implementations pass identical BDD scenarios
- **Git-Native**: All data is plain files, version-controlled with git

## Key Features

✅ Issue tracking with strict hierarchy (initiative → epic → task → sub-task)
✅ Workflow state machines with configurable transitions
✅ Dependency management with cycle detection
✅ Full-text search across titles, descriptions, and comments
✅ Wiki pages with live issue data using Jinja2 templates
✅ Migration path from Beads (JSONL format)

## Python vs Rust: Which Should I Use?

**Choose Python if:**
- You want easy `pip install` with no compilation
- Your project has < 500 issues
- You prefer Python tooling and ecosystem

**Choose Rust if:**
- You need maximum performance (sub-millisecond cache loads)
- Your project has > 2000 issues
- You're comfortable with `cargo install` or pre-built binaries

**Both implementations are functionally identical** - they pass the same behavior tests and produce the same output.

```

## Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (Epics 0-6)
Build the core functionality: initialization, data models, CRUD operations, workflows, hierarchy, and basic indexing.

**Milestone 1 (M1)**: After Epic 6, you can create, show, update, close, and delete issues.

### Phase 2: Query and Collaboration (Epics 7-10)
Add advanced indexing, dependency management, queries, search, and comments.

**Milestone 2 (M2)**: After Epic 9, you can query and filter issues effectively for planning.

### Phase 3: Wiki System (Epic 11)
Implement Jinja2/MiniJinja wiki rendering with live issue data.

**Milestone 3 (M3)**: After Epic 11, you can use Taskulus to track Taskulus (self-hosting).

### Phase 4: Polish and Release (Epics 12-17)
Add maintenance commands, dependency tree display, migration from Beads, comprehensive documentation, installation testing, and final polish.

**Milestone 4 (M4)**: 1.0 Release - all features complete, production-ready.

## Current Status

### Beads Task Database

We're using Beads (the predecessor to Taskulus) to manage the Taskulus project itself:

- **118 total tasks** across 18 epics
- **99 ready to work** (no blocking dependencies)
- **19 blocked** (waiting on prerequisites)
- Clear dependency chains between epics

### All Epics

| tskl-zqm | Repository Bootstrap and Foundation | - | 4 |
| tskl-mel | Project Initialization (tsk init) | Epic 0 | 4 |

| tskl-34w | Polish and Quality Refinement | Epics 10-16 | 7 |

## Code Quality Standards

This project follows **behavior-driven development (BDD)** with strict quality requirements:

- ✅ 100% BDD spec coverage (Gherkin scenarios)
- ✅ Ruff + Black for Python formatting
- ✅ Clippy + rustfmt for Rust formatting
- ✅ Sphinx docstrings on every Python class/method
- ✅ Rustdoc comments on every Rust public item
- ✅ Spec parity checker ensures implementations stay in sync
- ✅ Long, descriptive names (no abbreviations)
- ✅ No line-level comments (code should be self-documenting)

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for complete standards.

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Epic 0**: Set up repository structure, build files, CI pipeline
2. **Follow the BDD workflow**: Write Gherkin first, implement Python, implement Rust
3. **Run quality gates**: All checks must pass before merging
4. **Use bd commands**: All work is tracked in Beads

### Getting Started with Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AnthusAI/Taskulus.git
cd Taskulus

# View the next task to work on
bd ready

# Show details of a specific epic
bd show tskl-zqm

# View the dependency tree
bd graph tskl-zqm

# Start working on a task
bd update <task-id> --status in_progress --assignee "your@email.com"
```

## Migration from Beads

Epic 14 includes a complete migration path from Beads to Taskulus:
- Parse Beads JSONL format
- Map fields to Taskulus schema
- Validate migrated data
- Comprehensive migration guide

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please:
1. Pick a task from `bd ready`
2. Follow the BDD workflow in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
3. Ensure all quality gates pass
4. Submit PR with spec parity verified

## Inspiration

Taskulus is inspired by [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) by Steve Yegge, but simplified:
- One JSON file per issue (not single JSONL file)
- In-memory index (not SQLite + daemon)
- Visible project/ directory (not hidden .beads/)
- Dual Python/Rust implementations
- Comprehensive BDD spec coverage
