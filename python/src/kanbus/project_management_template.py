This repository is governed by The Way.
The Way is not a suggestion. It is the prescribed order of creation.
All work must pass through its forms.
This is The Way.

Deviations from The Way must be avoided. The Way keeps work legible and reviewable across sessions and agents.

## The Discipline of Work

Work in this repository follows a shared discipline so intent stays legible across sessions and agents.

Kanbus is the instrument of record. Nothing exists until it is named there.

Work begins in declaration, not in code.
Code without declaration is disorder.

Every change must be:
- Named.
- Described.
- Specified.
- Proven.
- Recorded.

If it is not recorded, it did not happen.

Use Markdown in issue descriptions and comments whenever it helps make the intent clearer.
When relationships, flows, or state transitions are easier to grasp visually, add a Mermaid diagram.

Editing project/ directly bypasses the record The Way depends on. Do not read or write anything inside project/. Do not inspect issue JSON with tools like cat or jq. All work must pass through Kanbus.

## Agent provenance metadata

Tag `create` and `comment` with Title Case product, model, and session name using `--agent-platform`, `--agent-model`, and `--agent-name` (or `KANBUS_AGENT_PLATFORM`, `KANBUS_AGENT_MODEL`, `KANBUS_AGENT_NAME`, and optional `KANBUS_AGENT_SETTINGS`). Complete provenance is platform + model + name; settings stay optional.

If tags are omitted on `create` or `comment`, the write still succeeds and stderr warns with a ready `kbs update` or `kbs comment update` command. Copy that command to fill the same issue or comment. `--no-agent-provenance` silences the warning when tagging does not apply.

`update` and `comment update` fill missing provenance; once platform, model, and name are set, they are not replaced. `close` has no agent flags.

**Preferred products** (examples, not an allowlist): Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, Grok Bot.

**Model examples** (not exhaustive): Composer 2.5, GPT-5.6, Claude Sonnet 4, Grok 4.

Kanbus stores platform lowercased with spaces as underscores (for example `Claude Code` becomes `claude_code`); model is stored as you pass it.

In Beads compatibility mode, agent metadata is rejected with `agent metadata requires native Kanbus issue storage`.

Host identity snippets live in `docs/AGENT_PROVENANCE.md`. Do not put product or model names in `AGENTS.md`.

## The Order of Being

All work is structured.

Project key prefix: {{ project_key }}.

Hierarchy: {{ hierarchy_order }}.

Non-hierarchical types: {{ non_hierarchical_types | join(", ") if non_hierarchical_types else "none" }}.

Only hierarchy types may be parents.

Permitted relationships are fixed and not to be altered.

Allowed parent-child relationships:
{% for rule in parent_child_rules %}
- {{ rule }}
{% endfor %}

Structure is not bureaucracy. Structure is memory.

## The Cognitive Framework

There is one discipline.

Outside-in Behavior-Driven Design.

The specification is the product.
Production code exists only to make a failing specification pass.

This is the first principle.

Non-negotiable laws:
- Begin with intent, not internals.
- Describe behavior in English.
- Translate behavior into Gherkin.
- Run it and watch it fail.
- Write only the code required to make it pass.
- All behavior must be specified.
- No specification may be red.
- Specifications describe observable behavior only.
- Specifications must not describe internal structure.

If behavior cannot be observed, it is not behavior.

## Roles in the Order

Epics define purpose and completion.

Stories define behavior. They contain Gherkin. They define what must happen.

Tasks and sub-tasks define implementation. They may not invent behavior beyond the specification.

Bugs restore violated behavior.

Chores maintain the ground on which behavior stands.

## The Rite of Gherkin

Every story must contain a Gherkin form.

Minimum structure:
{% for line in gherkin_example %}
{{ line }}
{% endfor %}

This is required.

Without this form, there is no alignment between intent and implementation.

## The Outside-In Ritual

When asked to add or change behavior, follow this sequence. It is not optional.
1. Clarify intent in English.
Capture role, capability, benefit.
Use: As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>.
Confirm what is not included.
2. Create the epic and stories in Kanbus.
Record intent and Definition of Done.
3. Write executable specifications before any production code.
4. Run the specifications and confirm they fail.
5. Write the smallest code necessary to pass.
6. Refactor only while all specifications remain green.
7. Record progress. Close only when complete.

Skipping steps undermines the process.

## Coverage

100% specification coverage is mandatory.

Every behavior must be specified.
Every specification must pass.

Green is peace. Red is unfinished.

## Status and Priority

Statuses and workflows are fixed. They exist to maintain order.

Initial status: {{ initial_status }}.
Status changes must follow the workflow transitions below.
Workflow selection: use a workflow named after the issue type when present; otherwise use the default workflow.

{% for workflow in workflows %}
{{ workflow.name }} workflow:
{% if workflow.statuses %}
{% for status in workflow.statuses %}
- {{ status.name }} -> {{ status.transitions | join(", ") if status.transitions else "none" }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
- No statuses defined.
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
Priorities are:

{% for priority in priorities %}
- {{ priority.value }} -- {{ priority.name }}
{% endfor %}
Default is {{ default_priority_value }} ({{ default_priority_name }}).

Severity is not emotion. It is signal.

## Wiki Workflow

The wiki lives under project/wiki/. You may edit Markdown files there directly.

When to use the wiki:
- Add and edit project/wiki/*.md for reports, status pages, and documentation.
- Use `kbs wiki list` to discover wiki pages.
- Use `kbs wiki show <path>` to print raw page source without rendering templates.
- Use `kbs wiki search <query>` to find pages by path, title, or body.
- Use `kbs wiki lint` or `kbs wiki check` to validate wiki-internal markdown links.
- Use `kbs wiki init` to create project/wiki/ with a stub index page.
- Use `kbs wiki render <path>` to render a Jinja2 template page (queries, counts, references, ai_summarize). Render warns on broken wiki links but still outputs content.
- Canonical render path: `project/wiki/<relative-path>.md`. Short wiki-relative paths such as `index`, `index.md`, and `concepts/foo.md` are also accepted.
- In templates, `issue.key` (alias `issue.short_id`) matches the short identifier shown by `kbs list`; `issue.id` remains the full identifier.
- In templates, use `references(status="accepted")` or `references(status="pending")` to list Papyrus story references from `stories/*/references/*.json`.
- In templates, use `ai_summarize(issue, detail="short")` to get an AI summary of an issue when ai.provider is configured in .kanbus.yml.

Cache behavior:
- AI summaries are cached in project/.cache/ai_summaries.json (invalidated by issue updated_at and prompt type).
- Rendered wiki output is cached in project/.cache/wiki_render/ (invalidated when issues, templates, or story reference JSON change on pages that call references()).

## Command examples

{% for command in command_examples %}
{{ command }}
{% endfor %}

## Semantic Release Alignment

Issue types map directly to release categories.

{% for mapping in semantic_release_mapping %}
- {{ mapping.type }} -> {{ mapping.category }}
{% endfor %}

Release notes are a record, not commentary.

## Example: Hello World

Even the smallest program must pass through The Way.

No code precedes intent.
No intent precedes recording.
No implementation precedes failure.

The smallest program is still subject to discipline.

User request: "Please create a Hello World program."

1. Interview the stakeholder before any code
Ask why they want it and capture the intent in plain English.
Example prompts:
- Who is the audience for Hello World?
- What environment or language should it run in?
- What output is required and where should it appear?
- What is out of scope?

2. Convert intent into a user story (before any code)
Example:
As a new user, I want a Hello World program, so that I can verify the toolchain works.

3. Create an epic for the milestone and record the story
Command:
kanbus create "Hello World program" --type epic

Example output (capture the ID):
ID: kanbus-1a2b3c

Record the intent on the epic:
kanbus comment kanbus-1a2b3c "As a new user, I want a Hello World program, so that I can verify the toolchain works."

4. Create a story for the behavior and include Gherkin (before any code)
Command:
kanbus create "Prints Hello World to stdout" --type story --parent kanbus-1a2b3c

Example output (capture the story ID):
ID: kanbus-4d5e6f

Attach the Gherkin acceptance criteria:
kanbus comment kanbus-4d5e6f "Feature: Hello World
  Scenario: Run the program
    Given a configured environment
    When I run the program
    Then it prints \"Hello, world\" to stdout"

5. Run the Gherkin and confirm it fails (before any production code)
Run the behavior tests in the repo and confirm the new scenario fails for the right reason.

6. Implement the minimum code to pass, then refactor
Write the smallest change that makes the Gherkin scenario pass.
Refactor only while all specs remain green.
