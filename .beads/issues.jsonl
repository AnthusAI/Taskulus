This epic implements a real-time notification system using broadcast channels that reduces latency from 15 seconds to <100ms.\n\nKey insight: Once we build the socket-based notification infrastructure for the focus feature, we can extend it to ALL CRUD operations (create, update, delete), enabling the entire board to update with much lower latency.\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Real-time Notification Infrastructure\n- Create notification_events.rs with NotificationEvent enum (IssueCreated, IssueUpdated, IssueDeleted, IssueFocused)\n- Extend console_local.rs with broadcast::channel for notifications\n- Create notification_publisher.rs to POST events to console server\n- Add SSE endpoint /api/events/realtime for streaming notifications\n\n### Phase 2: Hook CRUD Operations (see sub-tasks)\n- Hook issue_creation.rs, issue_update.rs, issue_delete.rs\n- Hook issue_comment.rs, dependencies.rs\n- Hook beads_write.rs for beads compatibility mode\n\n### Phase 3: Implement Focus Command\n- Add ConsoleCommands::Focus in cli.rs\n- Create focus handler that validates issue and publishes IssueFocused event\n- Add --focus flag to kbs create command for auto-focus on creation\n- Enable agents to invoke focus command\n\n### Phase 4: Frontend Integration\n- Add subscribeToNotifications() in api/client.ts\n- Handle notification events in App.tsx (focus, create, update, delete)\n- Add GSAP animations for visual feedback (see tskl-e7j.7)\n\n### Phase 5: Console Server Endpoints\n- POST /api/notifications - Receives events from CLI\n- GET /api/events/realtime - SSE stream for frontend\n- Use broadcast channel pattern like telemetry system\n\n## Critical Files\n\nBackend:\n- rust/src/bin/console_local.rs - Console server\n- rust/src/notification_events.rs (NEW)\n- rust/src/notification_publisher.rs (NEW)\n- rust/src/cli.rs - Add focus command\n\nFrontend:\n- apps/console/src/api/client.ts\n- apps/console/src/App.tsx\n- apps/console/src/components/IssueCard.tsx\n\n## Architecture Benefits\n\n1. Latency: 15 seconds → <100ms for all operations\n2. User Experience: Immediate feedback on all actions\n3. Agent Collaboration: Agents can direct human attention via focus\n4. Scalability: Broadcast channel supports multiple subscribers\n5. Backward Compatibility: Existing 15-second polling remains as fallback\n6. Extensibility: Easy to add new event types\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Notification failures should not block CRUD operations\n- Broadcast channel buffer (256) prevents memory bloat\n- SSE connection auto-reconnects on failure\n- Event payload kept small (<5KB)\n- Console server binds to localhost only","id":"tskl-e7j","issue_type":"epic","owner":"unknown","priority":2,"status":"closed","title":"Issue Focus Command","updated_at":"2026-02-18T12:44:09.475675+00:00"}

The frontend navigates to whatever URL it receives. The URL is the universal state contract -- same mechanism works for local server (SSE), cloud (WebSocket), or pasting a link.\n\nNo backwards-compatibility logic. This is the only way it works.\n\nArchitecture:\n- Server pushes URL routes to clients via SSE (e.g., /issues/tskl-abc?focused=tskl-abc&comment=8ea9cd)\n- All UI state is URL-addressable: view mode (path), focused issue (query param), search (query param), comment (query param)\n- AppState holds a ConsoleUiState cache of the last-pushed route (for CLI query commands)\n- State persists to .kanbus/.cache/console_state.json across server restarts\n- CLI query commands (kbs console status, get focus, get view, get search) read from the cache\n- New SSE subscribers receive the last-pushed route on connect\n\nStories:\n1. Server maintains canonical UI state in memory (cache of last-pushed route)\n2. State persists to .kanbus/.cache/console_state.json across restarts\n3. kbs console status -- prints full state summary\n4. kbs console get focus -- prints focused issue ID or none\n5. kbs console get view -- prints current view mode or none\n6. kbs console get search -- prints active search query\n7. All UI state is URL-addressable (search, focus, view mode in the URL)\n8. New browser tabs receive last-pushed route on connect\n9.
