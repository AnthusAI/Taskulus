It does not chase full compatibility at all costs; some templates that look valid in Jinja2 will not render in MiniJinja, but cross-compatible templates are possible. MiniJinja syntax matches Jinja2 in many areas but has documented differences, e.g., line statement/comment whitespace behavior differs from Jinja2 and requires custom_syntax, and inline if without else returns a silent undefined. Also, template imports behave differently: imports are not cached and only exported variables/macros are available. Implication for Taskulus wiki: keep template feature set small and explicitly documented, avoid reliance on Jinja2-only edge cases (line statements whitespace, import side effects), and build specs around the shared subset.","created_at":"2026-02-12T01:45:05Z"}]}
